The Supermarket Mobile App is a modern, native Android application designed to streamline the grocery shopping experience. It allows users to efficiently organize their shopping lists, track expenses, and easily access detailed product information.

Developed entirely in Kotlin, the application leverages the latest Android development practices. The user interface is built declaratively using Jetpack Compose, ensuring a reactive, modern, and visually appealing experience without the use of traditional XML layouts.


Key Features:

Product Catalog: Users can browse a comprehensive catalog of supermarket products, complete with images, descriptions, prices, and availability. The catalog is organized into intuitive categories.

Advanced Search & Filtering: Powerful search functionality allows users to find specific items quickly. Products can also be filtered by category, price, or special offers.

Dynamic Shopping List: The core feature of the app. Users can add products to their shopping list, adjust quantities, and see the estimated total cost update in real-time.

Wishlist: A separate list for users to save products they are interested in for future purchases.

Purchase History & Analytics: The app saves completed shopping lists, allowing users to review their past purchases. It also provides simple analytics to compare spending on a weekly or monthly basis.

Promotions and Discounts: Special offers and sales are clearly highlighted throughout the app to help users find the best deals.

Offline Functionality: The app is fully functional offline, as it relies on a local Room database that is considered to be synced when an internet connection is available.


This project demonstrates a modern approach to Android development, focusing on clean architecture (MVVM), a reactive UI with Jetpack Compose, and robust data management with Room.
